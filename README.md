# San Diego Natural History Museum Donor/Member Cohort Anyslis 
Donor/member analysis and market segmentation for the San Diego Natural History Museum using Python. The project found and isolated donors and members who are most likely to advance their contributions to the instituion based on their behavior in the data. The project used various analytical tools including Kmeans clustering; however, the bulk of the project was subsetting various cohorts based reccorded and past contributions behavior. </br></br>The primary challenge with this project was taking the data provided of *donations* and *memberships*, with typically multiple observations per constituent, and collapse it down to a dataset of *donors* and *members* while losing as little data and granularity as possible.
