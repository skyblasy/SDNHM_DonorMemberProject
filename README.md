## San Diego Natural History Museum Donor/Member Analysis
### By Schuyler Blasy
This was a market segmentation project for the San Diego Natural History Museum using Python and donation and membership reccords. The project found and isolated donors and members who are most likely to advance their contributions to the instituion based on their behavior in the data. </br></br>The primary challenge with this project was taking the data provided of *donations* and *memberships*, with typically multiple observations per constituent, and collapse it down to a dataset of *donors* and *members* while losing as little data and granularity as possible. This required a significant amount of data manipulation, transformation, and feature engineering. </br></br>Defining and segmenting the museum's primary market was done through two primary means, Kmeans clustering and using Pandas and Numpy to merge and create subsets of the contributors based on their behavior as criteria indicated by the Development Team at the musuem. The resulting deliverables were very refined cohorts, subsets, and niche classes of museum contributors that could be uniquely marketed to for furhter progression in the donor pipeline.
